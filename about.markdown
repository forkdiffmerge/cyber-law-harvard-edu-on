# About

**Mission**

The Berkman Center's mission is to explore and understand cyberspace; to study 
its development, dynamics, norms, and standards; and to assess the need or 
lack thereof for laws and sanctions.

We are a research center, premised on the observation that what we seek to 
learn is not already recorded. Our method is to build out into cyberspace, 
record data as we go, self-study, and share. Our mode is entrepreneurial nonprofit.

**The Center in Brief**

The Berkman Center was founded to explore cyberspace, share in its study, and 
help pioneer its development. We represent a network of faculty, students, 
fellows, entrepreneurs, lawyers, and virtual architects working to identify 
and engage with the challenges and opportunities of cyberspace.

We [investigate][13] the real and possible boundaries in cyberspace between 
open and closed systems of code, of commerce, of governance, and of education, 
and the relationship of law to each. We do this through active rather than 
passive research, believing that the best way to understand cyberspace is to 
actually build out into it.

Our [faculty][14], [fellows][15], students, and affiliates engage with a wide 
spectrum of Net issues, including governance, privacy, intellectual property, 
antitrust, content control, and electronic commerce. Our diverse research interests 
cohere in a common understanding of the Internet as a social and political 
space where constraints upon inhabitants are determined not only through the 
traditional application of law, but, more subtly, through technical architecture 
("code").

As part of our active research mission, we build, use, and freely share open 
software platforms for free [online lectures and discussions][16]. We also 
sponsor [gatherings][17], ranging from informal lunches to international conferences, 
that bring together members of our diverse network of participants to swap 
insights – and sometimes barbs – as they stake out their respective visions 
for what the Net can become. We also [teach][18], seeking out online and global 
opportunities, as well as supporting the traditional Harvard Law School curriculum, 
often in conjunction with other Harvard schools and MIT.
